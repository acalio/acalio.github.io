Surprisingly, in the classic problem of influence maximization in social networks, relatively little study has been devoted to diversity and its integration into the objective function of an influence maximization method. In this work, we propose the integration of a categorical-based notion of seed diversity into the objective function of a targeted influence maximization problem. In this respect, we assume that the users of a social network are associated with a categorical dataset where each tuple expresses the profile of a user according to a predefined schema of categorical attributes. Upon this assumption, we design a class of monotone submodular functions specifically conceived for determining the diversity of the subset of categorical tuples associated with the seed users to be discovered. This allows us to develop an efficient approximate method, with a constant-factor guarantee of optimality. More precisely, we formulate the attribute-based diversity-sensitive targeted influence maximization problem under the state-of-the-art reverse influence sampling framework, and we develop a method, dubbed ADITUM, that ensures a (1-1/e-∊)-approximate solution under the general triggering diffusion model. Extensive experimental evaluation based on real-world networks as well as synthetically generated data has shown the meaningfulness and uniqueness of our proposed class of set diversity functions and of the ADITUM algorithm, also in comparison with methods that exploit numerical-attribute-based diversity and topology-driven diversity in influence maximization.","tags":["\"diversity in influence maximization\"","\"monotone submodular categorical set functions\"","\"reverse influence sampling\"","\"social recommendation\"","\"viral marketing\""],"title":"Attribute based Diversification of Seeds for Targeted Influence Maximization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["antonio calio","andrea tagarelli"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601723266,"objectID":"e72e7d0c4135aeab19f56edf42f869e6","permalink":"/publication/calio-framework-nodate/","publishdate":"2020-10-03T11:07:46.349304Z","relpermalink":"/publication/calio-framework-nodate/","section":"publication","summary":"What are the key-features that enable an information diffusion model to explain the inherent complex dynamics of real-world propagation phenomena?

To validate our models through real-world networks, we also discuss diﬀerent strategies for the selection of the initial inﬂuencers to mimic non-competitive and competitive diﬀusion scenarios, inspired by the widely-known problem of limitation of misinformation spread.

Several studies have exploited both mesoscale structures and local centrality measures in order to estimate the spreading potential of nodes. To this end, one known result in the literature establishes a correlation between the spreading potential of a node and its coreness: i.e., in a core-decompostion of a network, nodes in higher cores have a stronger influence potential on the rest of the network. In this paper we show that the above result does not hold in general under common settings of propagation models with submodular activation function on directed networks, as those ones used in the influence maximization (IM) problem. Motivated by this finding, we extensively explore where the set of influential nodes extracted by state-of-the-art IM methods are located in a network w.r.t. different notions of graph decomposition. Our analysis on real-world networks provides evidence that, regardless of the particular IM method, the best spreaders are not always located within the inner-most subgraphs defined according to commonly used graph-decomposition methods. We identify the main reasons that explain this behavior, which can be ascribed to the inability of classic decomposition methods in incorporating higher-order degree of nodes. By contrast, we find that a distance-based generalization of the core-decomposition for directed networks can profitably be exploited to actually restrict the location of candidate solutions for IM to a single, well-defined portion of a network graph.","tags":[],"title":"Cores matter?

These include accounting for several dynamic aspects in the propagation (e.g., latency, time horizon), dealing with multiple cascades of information that might occur competitively, accounting for the contingencies that lead a user to change her/his adoption of one or alternative information items, and leveraging trust/distrust in the users’ relationships and its effect of influence on the users’ decisions. To the best of our knowledge, no diffusion model unifying all of the above requirements has been developed so far. In this work, we address such a challenge and propose a novel class of diffusion models, inspired by the classic linear threshold model, which are designed to deal with trust-aware, non-competitive as well as competitive time-varying propagation scenarios. Our theoretical inspection of the proposed models unveils important findings on the relations with existing linear threshold models for which properties are known about whether monotonicity and submodularity hold for the corresponding activation function. We also propose strategies for the selection of the initial spreaders of the propagation process, for both non-competitive and competitive influence propagation tasks, whose goal is to mimic contexts of misinformation spread. Our extensive experimental evaluation, which was conducted on publicly available networks and included comparison with competing methods, provides evidence on the meaningfulness and uniqueness of our models.","tags":[],"title":"Complex influence propagation based on trust-aware dynamic linear threshold models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["antonio caliò","roberto interdonato","chiara pulice","andrea tagarelli"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601723266,"objectID":"825bf87dd76154103299829b59290c5a","permalink":"/publication/calio-topology-driven-2018/","publishdate":"2020-10-03T11:07:46.07962Z","relpermalink":"/publication/calio-topology-driven-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Research on influence maximization ofter has to cope with marketing needs relating to the propagation of information towards specific users. However, little attention has been paid to the fact that the success of an information diffusion campaign might depend not only on the number of the initial influencers to be detected but also on their diversity w.r.t. the target of the campaign. Our main hypothesis is that if we learn seeds that are not only capable of influencing but also are linked to more diverse (groups of) users, then the influence triggers will be diversified as well, and hence the target users will get higher chance of being engaged. Upon this intuition, we define a novel problem, named Diversity-sensitive Targeted Influence Maximization (DTIM), which assumes to model user diversity by exploiting only topological information within a social graph. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to bring the concept of topology-driven diversity into targeted IM problems, for which we define two alternative definitions. Accordingly, we propose approximate solutions of DTIM, which detect a size- $k$ set of users that maximizes the diversity-sensitive capital objective function, for a given selection of target users. We evaluate our DTIM methods on a special case of user engagement in online social networks, which concerns users who are not actively involved in the community life. Experimental evaluation on real networks has demonstrated the meaningfulness of our approach, also highlighting the opportunity of further development of solutions for DTIM applications.","tags":["\"behavioral sciences\"","\"cultural differences\"","\"diversity-sensitive influence propagation\"","\"linear programming\"","\"linear threshold diffusion model\"","\"lurking behavior analysis\"","\"social capital\"","\"social network services\"","\"task analysis\""],"title":"Topology-Driven Diversity for Targeted Influence Maximization with Application to User Engagement in Social Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["antonio caliò","andrea tagarelli"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1533081600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1601723266,"objectID":"78914e7ea63edcf22a77b96cc84d6832","permalink":"/publication/calio-trust-based-2018/","publishdate":"2020-10-03T11:07:46.21433Z","relpermalink":"/publication/calio-trust-based-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"What are the key-features that enable an information diffusion model to explain the inherent dynamic, and often competitive, nature of real-world propagation phenomena?
